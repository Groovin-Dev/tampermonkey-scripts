## Tampermonkey Scripts

This is a place for me to store my various tampermonkey scripts

## Structure

```
├── scripts
    ├── site-name
        ├── script-name
            ├── script-name.js // Actual Script
            ╰── readme.md // What it does
```

## How to install
To install, go to the desired script and press **raw** at the top right of the code display. That should open Tampermonkey and allow you to install from there.
